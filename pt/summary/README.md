# After the Workshop

If you don't mind spending some time helping people after the workshop, we encourage you to stay in touch with your team. It is great to have a mentor - somebody to ask a question if you are stuck with something.

## Improve the tutorial!

In fact, it's helpful to do it even **during the workshop**. If you see that something in the tutorial is wrong, take the 5 minutes to submit a Pull Request right away. Or even better: teach your group how to do it! It's important to do it *right away*, otherwise you will forget. Believe us, we've all been there. 

If for some reason, you can't do it right away, [at least report an issue](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/tutorial/issues). The tutorial is getting invaluably better with each event that takes place. It is important. 

## Share your experience with us

Teaching others is a very hard thing. You will learn a lot during the workshop and we would be happy to hear about your experiences as a coach.

Please share all your findings with us. We will keep making the tutorial better and more complete.

Drop us a line at hello@djangogirls.org.


## Stay in touch with your group

As much as possible, please stay in touch with your group after the event. Answer their questions, encourage them to follow on with programming or invite them to your local Python meetup. It's super important to have a friendly face in the community.
